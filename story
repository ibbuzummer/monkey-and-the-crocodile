Once upon a time, a monkey lived in a tree by a river.
 The monkey was alone as he had no friends or family but he was happy and content. 
 The tree gave him plenty of sweet jamun fruit to eat. 
 It also gave him shade from the sun and shelter from the rain.

 One day, a crocodile was swimming up the river. 
 He climbed on to the bank to rest under the monkey's tree.

'Hello,' called the monkey, who was a friendly animal.

'Hello,' replied the crocodile, surprised. 
'Do you know where I can get some food?' he asked. 
'I haven't had anything to eat all day and I am hungry.'

Now you might think that the crocodile would want to eat the monkey, 
but this was a very kind and gentle crocodile and the thought never entered his head.

'I have lots of fruit in my tree. 
Would you like to try some?' said the monkey, who was also very kind.

He threw some jamun fruit down to the crocodile. 
The crocodile was so hungry that he ate up all the jamuns 
even though crocodiles don't usually eat fruit. 
He loved the sweet tangy fruit and the pink flesh made his tongue turn purple.
